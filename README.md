1. Add the name of the event in this field. If it is a Lunch and Learn, be sure to include that in the beginning of the title.
2. Add the description of the event here. You may have to use some HTML under the "Text" tab in order to create tables for different level sponsorships.
3. This is where you will save drafts, preview the event, and publish the final event. 
      The "Status" indicates whether the event is in draft, pending review, or published status.
      The "Visibility" indicates whether the event is public, password protected, or private. Events will most likely always be public.
      The "Publish" field can be edited to publish the event at a date in the past, immediately, or in the future.
      While creating the event, it's important to click "Save Draft" and "Preview" along the process to make sure everything saves and looks correct.
      Once the event is ready to be published (after you finish the following steps), you'll click the "Publish" button.

      1. **Enter Event Title** - Add the name of the event in this field. If it is a Lunch and Learn, be sure to include that in the beginning of the title.
      
      2. **Add Description** - Add the description of the event here. You may have to use some HTML under the "Text" tab in order to create tables for different level sponsorships.
      
      3. **Publish/Save the Event** - This is where events are saved as drafts, can be previewed, and finally published. 
      
            * The "Status" indicates whether the event is in draft, pending review, or published status.
            * The "Visibility" indicates whether the event is public, password protected, or private. Events will most likely always be public.
            * The "Publish" field can be edited to publish the event at a date in the past, immediately, or in the future.
            * While creating the event, it's important to click "Save Draft" and "Preview" along the process to make sure everything saves and looks correct.
            * Once the event is ready to be published (after you finish the following steps), you'll click the "Publish" button.
            
      4. **Categorize the Event** - This is where events are categorized. This makes it so the web visitor can separate the events its type.
      
      5. **Update the Event's SEO** - Filling out this section with relevant words will help with the Search Engine Optimization for the event page. 
      
      6. **Set the Event's Featured Image** - Add a featured image for the event. This will be the image that shows up as the banner for the event and if the event is the featured event, will show up on the DMAW homepage. The image should be approximately 3000px x 850px.
